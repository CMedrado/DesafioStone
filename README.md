### üöÄ How It Works

This project is just the back end part (server folder)
### üöß Application / Dependencies

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

I recommend having an editor to work with code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and having an api client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)


It was stored in containers using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### üé≤ How to Begin

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone <https://github.com/CMedrado/DesafioStone>

# Access the project folder in the terminal/cmd
$ cd DesafioStone

# Go to local folder within deploy
$ cd deploy/local

# Run the application
$ docker-compose up --build -d

# The server will start on port:5000 - go to <http://localhost:3333>
```
