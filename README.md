### üöß Application / Dependencies

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

I recommend having an editor to work with code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and having an api client
like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

The Api is delivered in containers using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### üé≤ How to Begin

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone <https://github.com/CMedrado/DesafioStone>

# Access the project folder in the terminal/cmd
$ cd DesafioStone

# Run the application
$ Make run-local

# The server will start on port:5000 - go to <http://localhost:3333>
```

### Makefile

There are three commands to be used as a shortcut

- Make build-image:
    - This shortcut corresponds to "docker build -t rafaelcmedrado/desafio:latest -f build/Dockerfile ."
- Make push-image:
    - This shortcut corresponds to "docker push rafaelcmedrado/desafio:latest"
- Make run-local:
    - This shortcut corresponds to "docker-compose -f deploy/local/docker-compose.yml up"

### üõ† Technologies

The following tools were used in the construction of the project:

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Golang](https://golang.org/)
- [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
- [Envconfig](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig)
